Pessaries are often used to treat conditions such as uterine prolapse, in which the uterus drops down into the vagina, and stress urinary incontinence, in which urine leaks out when there is pressure on the bladder, such as when coughing, sneezing, or exercising. Pessaries can also be used to treat uterine fibroids, which are non-cancerous growths that develop in the uterus, and can be used as an alternative to surgery in some cases.

Pessaries can be used to deliver medication directly to the vaginal area. This can be helpful in cases where the medication needs to be absorbed directly into the tissue in order to be effective. Pessaries can be used to deliver a variety of medications, including hormonal contraceptives, antifungals, and other types of medications used to treat conditions such as infections, inflammation, and other gynecological disorders. Some pessaries are designed to release the medication over a period of time, while others are intended to be removed and replaced with a new pessary after a certain period of time.

Pessaries can be a convenient and effective way to deliver medication to the vaginal area, although they may not be suitable for everyone. They may cause discomfort or irritation in some people. It’s important to follow your healthcare provider’s instructions for using pessaries, including when to insert and remove them and how often to replace them. It is important to follow the instructions for use provided by your healthcare provider and to have regular check-ups to ensure that the pessary is working properly and performing its intended function.
